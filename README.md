# Game Of Life

### Pure Javascript implementation of Conway's Game of Life. 

The game supports customization during initialization and functions to manually Start, Stop and Iterate to the next generation.
The repo contains a full-featured example ([index.html](index.html)) and a simple implementation with no configuration or events handling ([index-simplest.html](index-simplest.html)).



The default styles allow to use light or dark mode (body with background #FFF or #000) with no further changes required in the CSS. 

Available customizations:
  - Number of rows
  - Number of columns
  - Time interval between generation
  - Number of rows
  - Initial alive cells
